What is Graph Coloring ?
	A way in which all the vertices of a given graph are assigned unique colors
	so that no adjacent vertices share same color. Finding minimum number of
	colors for assignment is the Graph Coloring problem. More info can be 
	found on wiki : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_coloring
===============================================================================

Background
	This problem was given as a final project in Advanced Algorithm course by
	Suresh V at University of Utah.(input graph files are taken from his data
	set) Even though I did some other project, I found coloring problem 
	interesting and hence here I am!
===============================================================================

Building the project
	Run 'make' at the root folder
	Run 'make clean' to clean intermediate and output files
===============================================================================

Running the project
	Run './gc.out <input graph file>'
	For example './gc.out input/1.g'
===============================================================================

Format of the input Graph File
	First line : <Number of Vertices> <Number of edges>
	All other lines will contain : <Vertex Number> <Connected vertices separated by a space>
	For example for the graph below
	1--2--4
	|  |  |
	---3---
	The graph file would look like
	4 5
	1 2 3 
	2 1 3 4
	3 1 2 4
	4 2	3
===============================================================================

Version
	Initial version - 0.1
===============================================================================

Features
	RLF(Recursive Largest First) and Randomized RLF have been implemented.
===============================================================================

Issues
	RLF implementation produces chromatic number off by few (less than 10). For example,
	it produces 107 for a graph with chromatic number 100 while the randomized version
	produces 105. Deterministic RLF should have been more accurate.
